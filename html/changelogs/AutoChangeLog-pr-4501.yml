  - balance: "The TGMC has decided to cut cost via cutting some corners with the TL-84 flamethrower, making it only spread fire through 6 tiles instead of the previous 7."
  - balance: "Alongside the TGMC cutting the costs and abiding by new regulations imposed on the flamethrower, they have cut the ammo on the tanks that the flamethrowers use, alongside slowing down the amount of time needed to reload a flamethrower with a tank due to safety concerns. With the Normal tank now requiring 2 seconds to reload with and having it's 60 units of fuel being cut down to 50, and the Large tank now requiring 3 seconds to reload with and having it's 100 units of fuel being cut down to 75."
